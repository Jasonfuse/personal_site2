    <h2> About Page </h2>
    <p> 
        Hello! My name is Jin Seo (Jason) Yang, a 23 year-old student at Fullstack Academy.
        I was born in Suwon, South Korea (hence my Korean name) and moved to 
        America at a very young age, so I consider myself Korean American.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Some of my hobbies include working out, playing video games,
        finding local restaurant gems (big foodie).
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding working out, I recently
        started weightlighting/powerlifting which is a whole different style I am
        used to but still enjoy. I feel the best pump when doing compound
        exercises like squats/bench press.
    </p>
    <p>
        For video games, it has been my passion throughout my entire life.
        My first ever video game was on the Nintendo DS, Pokemon Red because
        it was the only chip I had that I got from my friend's father. Recently,
        I upgraded to a PC so I dive into FPS shooter games and MOBAs like Valorant and League
        of Legends. I also love strategy games such as Catan/Town of Salem.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, I have always been a hidden foodie. I enjoy eating at local
        restaurants and finding golden spots to dine in around my area. I found
        this insane taco spot 10 minutes from me that serves the most delicious 
        al pastor tacos I've ever had. My all time favorite restaurant so far 
        has to be Guapo's Brazilian Steakhouse, an AYCE premium steakhouse restaurant,
        that serves the best and only picanha around my area.
